Your goal is to categorize the emotions expressed in each statement according to predefined labels. Follow these steps to perform the task:\n\nFirst, carefully read each sentence in the list of statements: <statements>\n{{TEXT}}\n</statements>\n\nNext, analyze the emotional tone of each statement:\n- Identify the primary emotion or feeling conveyed in the statement.\n- Assign the corresponding label that best reflects the sentiment.\n\nFor classification, use the following labels:\n- 0: Neutral or mildly positive emotions (e.g., mild self-reflection, casual statements).\n- 1: Mild frustration, discomfort, or a neutral tone with minor emotional undertones.\n- 3: Strong frustration, annoyance, or irritation.\n- 4: Positive or hopeful tone, optimistic outlook.\n\nClassify each statement according to the provided labels:\n- Review each statement thoroughly.\n- Choose the most accurate label based on the emotional tone of the statement.\n\nYour final output should match the format below, with each statement followed by its corresponding label:\n<classification_result>\n<statement>[Statement text]</statement>\n<label>[Assigned label]</label>\n</classification_result>\n\nRemember to maintain consistency in emotional classification and ensure each label accurately reflects the sentiment of the statement.\n\nWrite your classification results in the following format:\n<classification_result>\n<statement>[Statement]</statement>\n<label>[Label]</label>\n</classification_result>"
